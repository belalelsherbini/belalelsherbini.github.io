### What I Did
- Developed a **6-band graphic equalizer** for stereo audio, enabling user adjustable gain across 6 distinct frequency bands.

### How I Did It
- **Modelled** the system **mathematically** and created block diagrams to depict signal pipeline.
- Implemented digital signal processing algorithms (**FFT**, **IFFT**, **filtering**) in **Python** with **Numpy** and **SciPy**.
- Designed a responsive **graphical user interface** using **Tkinter**.

### Outcomes
- Became proficient in understanding use cases of popular signal processing methods such as the FFT and IFFT.
- Developed a strong foundation in system-level design, including general planning and modular decomposition.
