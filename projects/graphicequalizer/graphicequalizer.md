### What I Did
- Designed and simulated a **2.45 GHz RF PCB** featuring an **SMA connector**, passive **bandpass filter**, inset-fed **patch antenna**, and impedance-matched transitions to ensure optimal wireless signal integrity.

### How I Did It
- Simulated inset-fed patch antenna in **Ansys HFSS** and optimized design parameters such as inset feed length and depth, patch length and width, and notch width.
- Designed **PCB layout** and **stackup** in **Altium Designer**, optimizing trace geometry for impedance matching while meeting manufacturer capabilities.

### Outcomes
- Achieved **3.04 dB** **gain** at 2.4624 GHz, **-19.8 dB return loss** (>99% power delivery), and **43.57 Î© input impedance.**
- Gained proficiency with Ansys HFSS and Altium Designer.
- Thoroughly understood **smith chart** and **S parameter analysis** and impact on RF circuit design.
