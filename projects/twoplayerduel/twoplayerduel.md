## What I Did
- Programmed and extensively debugged a PsoC6 based board to create a two player game in C++.

## How I Did It
- Used **FreeRTOS** for real time user controls and **UART** to transmit time sensitive data between boards.
- Collected input from various **sensors** (joystick, button, IMU, etc.) using **I2C** and processed data to dictate player action.

## Outcomes
- Learned how to use FreeRTOS to create **responsive MCU projects**.
- Gained proficiency with the UART communication protocol.
- Learned to quickly peruse **documentation** to find crucial information.
